  Hannah Arendts- any action is political if performed in public
  but what does that exclude
  disabled = a political
</p>

<p>
  Arendt was worried if everthing is political than nothing is
  Personal is political = private is political
  
  The inevitablity of violence at BLM
</p>


we must contend with the fact that many
whom these protests are for, are not able to participate in them – which means they are not able
to be visible as political activists.

There was a Tumblr post that came across my dash during these weeks of protest, that said
something to the effect of: “shout out to all the disabled people, sick people, people with PTSD,
anxiety, etc., who can’t protest in the streets with us tonight. Your voices are heard and valued,
and with us.” Heart. Reblog.

Most medical literature tends
to presume a white and middle-class subject for whom feeling bad is frequently a mystery because
it doesn’t fit a life in which privilege and comfort make things seem fine on the surface.” In other
words, wellness as it is talked about in America today, is a white and wealthy idea.

The question of why the hospital’s doctors thought Brock “delusional” because of her Obamafollow claim is easily answered: Because, according to this society, a young black woman can’t
possibly be that important – and for her to insist that she is must mean she’s “sick.”

Even if you don't identifly as sick, if you are presevied as such 
it has a severir impact 


Sick Woman Theory,” and how it inherited its name,
came from a few sources. The primary one was a way to think how illness, disability, and
vulnerability feminize—e.g., render “weaker” and “more fragile”—any person who requires care. 
<p>
  
  
  Sick Woman Theory is an insistence that most modes of political protest are internalized, lived,
  embodied, suffering, and no doubt invisible. Sick Woman Theory redefines existence in a body as
  something that is primarily and always vulnerable, following from Judith Butler’s recent work on
  precarity and resistance. Because Butler’s premise insists that a body is defined by its vulnerability,
  not temporarily affected by it, the implication is that it is continuously reliant on infrastructures
  of support in order to endure, and so we need to re-shape the world around this fact
</p>

“Sickness” as we speak of it today is a capitalist construct, as is its perceived binary opposite,
“wellness.” The “well” person is the person well enough to go to work. The “sick” person is the
one who can’t
