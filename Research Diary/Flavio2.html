          34, 36, 38, 40, 42… Magali Reus measures an imagined water level rising throughout her first institutional solo exhibition in London. These numbers appear to reference those on a ship’s hull or a flood-level marker, they reiterate across the space, quietly incised into the curving walls that Reus has installed to move the visitor fluidly through the exhibition. Yet there is no water here, and this obvious lack, coupled with the repetition of the numbers, seems to imply either that a deluge is coming or that a drought has arrived, lending the exhibition a subtle sense of foreboding.

In addition to the fateful engravings, Reus includes sculptural works from two series: Hwael and Sentinel, as well a standalone work, Crane (all works 2017). Reminiscent of a hotel welcome-desk, the bulky body of Crane is topped by toppled casts of buckets and vases onto which are printed images of tickets – lottery, delicatessen, cinema, etc – and that spew out raw-concrete-coloured casts of Styrofoam packing-peanuts and slender white numbers. On the panels of the ‘desk’ are a series of jauntily positioned grey reliefs that appear to be zoomed-into sections of mountain maps or tourism brochures for hiking.

The overall effect of her accumulated works being a sort of unsteady sculptural transformation of the world around us.

The three works in the Hwael series (the title derives from the Anglo-Saxon word for whale) each consists of a dislocated skeleton of powder-coated metal tubing – evocative of handrails on a public bus – adorned with boilerlike forms, weights, counterweights and the holes you might find on an adjustable crutch. The series reveal Reus’s characteristic layering and repeating of diverse, seemingly recognisable objects, modified through playful shifts in scale, materiality and contextual associations. The frame of Hwael (The Flat), for example, supports a rectangular box containing a scrap of card on which the words ‘FOX GLACIER’ are painted, while from the card hang a camping spoon (engraved with the letters ‘AM’) and fork (‘PM’). Hwael (Fully Automatic Time) sports scratchy engravings of football tactics and a selection of athletes’ signatures, while Hwael (Soft Soap) holds blank silhouettes of ‘do not disturb’ signs and a floral coathanger that peeps from a fibreglass cupboard.

            The Wretched of the Screen (quotes)
            
            According to common logic, a missing person is either dead or alive. But is she really? Doesn’t this only apply at the moment when we find out what happened to her? When she turns up or when her remains are identified? But what, then, is the state of missing itself? Does it take place inside Schrödinger’s box, so to speak? Is it being both dead and alive? How can we understand its conflicting desires: to want and to dread the truth at the same time? The urge to both move on and keep hope alive? Perhaps the state of missing speaks of a paradoxical superposition that cannot be understood with the conceptual tools of Euclidian physics, human biology, or Aristotelian logic. Perhaps it reaches out to an impossible coexistence of life and death. Both are materially interlaced in limbo—as long as no observer opens the “box” of indeterminacy. Which is, in many cases,
            
            So, what’s the point of becoming a thing or an
            image? Why should one accept alienation, bruises,
            and objectification?
            
            
            
             In writing about the Surrealists, Walter
            Benjamin emphasizes the liberating force within
            things.9
             In the commodity fetish, material drives
            intersect with affect and desire, and Benjamin
            fantasizes about igniting these compressed
            forces, to awaken “the slumbering collective from
            the dream-filled sleep of capitalist production”
            to tap into these forces.10 He also thinks that
            things could speak to one another through these
            forces.11 Benjamin’s idea of participation—a
            partly subversive take on early twentieth-century
            primitivism—claims that it is possible to join in
            this symphony of matter. For him, modest and even
            abject objects are hieroglyphs in whose dark prism
            social relations lay congealed and in fragments.
            They are understood as nodes, in which the tensions of a historical moment materialize in a flash
            of awareness or twist grotesquely into the commodity fetish. In this perspective, a thing is never
            just an object, but a fossil in which a constellation
            of forces are petrified. Things are never just inert
            objects, passive items, or lifeless shucks, but consist of tensions, forces, hidden powers, all being
            constantly exchanged
            
            
            
            Why should that be the case? Let’s start with
            a small detour on artistic autonomy. Artistic autonomy was traditionally predicated not on occupation,
            but on separation—more precisely, on art’s separation from life.9
             As artistic production became more
            specialized in an industrial world marked by an
            110
            111
            increasing division of labor, it also grew increasingly
            divorced from direct functionality.10 While it apparently evaded instrumentalization, it simultaneously
            lost social relevance. As a reaction, different avantgardes set out to break the barriers of art and to
            recreate its relation to life.
             Their hope was for art to dissolve within life,
            to be infused with a revolutionary jolt. What happened was rather the contrary. To push the point: life
            has been occupied by art, because art’s initial forays
            back into life and daily practice gradually turned
            into routine incursions, and then into constant
            occupation. Nowadays, the invasion of life by art is
            not the exception, but the rule. Artistic autonomy
            was meant to separate art from the zone of daily
            routine—from mundane life, intentionality, utility,
            production, and instrumental reason—in order to
            distance it from rules of efficiency and social coercion. But this incompletely segregated area then
            incorporated all that it broke from in the first place,
            recasting the old order within its own aesthetic
            paradigms. The incorporation of art within life was
            once a political project (both for the Left and Right),
            but the incorporation of life within art is now an
            aesthetic project, and it coincides with an overall
            aestheticization of politics.

            to digital structures. Indeed, the material on which the images are printed and the physical space

            to biologists. Although generally considered in abstract terms, these elements
            function as the foundational building blocks of our perceptible world. Take digital
            images for example: What we see on screen are not apparitions but tangible
            visual information. From this standpoint, artist Andrey Bogush dissects digital
            photography as material that can be calculated, coded, and manipulated. For
            his exhibition “When Everything Is Over So We Can Discuss,” at Finnish Museum
            of Photography, Bogush renders quotidian photographs—shot while working at
            home or in nature—with digital patterns and hazy swaths or scribbles of color.
            Pulling these images off the screen and into sculptural space, Bogush printed
            them on industrial vinyl and has hung them as rippled curtains lining the walls or
            as flat carpets on the floor. Using similar tropes as artists such as Alice Channer
            or Lucas Blalock, Bogush features warped, shifted, deleted, and replicated details
            captured in metamorphoses. For example, elongated appendages are overlain with
            nebulous blobs of purple and diffused gray in Proposal for Hand, Content Aware
            Fill and Violet, 2016, while visually fractured and partially replicated fingers and
            textiles are seen in Proposal for Hand, Phone and Duplicated Curtain, 2015.
            Representing digital tools of production, smart phones and laptops are combined
            with plant matter that makes appearances throughout. At times, images are
            reconfigured and juxtaposed as floating screens cut and pasted at angles, then
            flattened onto gradient layers, collapsing the visual depth of the foreground and
            background. Life experienced daily on-screen bears equal weight to that captured
            in physical space, and as distinctions begin to blur, digital life for artists like
            Bogush has long become second nature.

            “Why won’t you admit that we’re standing in a cruise ship?”, says my wife. We are at Magali Reus’s exhibition As mist, description, held at South London Gallery in the spring of 2018, and we have reached an impasse. She is also indignant that the gallery has failed to mention this crucial information in the literature. In the assemblages around the room I see the ghosts of many familiar things. Gas meters, the interior design common to corporate lobbies, flower pots and vases, plastic toy model kits with snap-off parts. What I do not see is a cruise ship.

            “You can at least agree that this is an onboard firehose,” she says, directing my attention to a length of red, white and green striped fabric coming out of a dispenser on the wall. The end of the fabric is carefully folded on a separate shelf, wedged in position by two pieces of serious-looking metal hardware – the sort of parts you don’t want coming off in your hand when attempting DIY plumbing. I inspect the objects before me, and find their flawless surfaces, and the pernickety, demonstrative manner of their display, unnervingly cool, as if they have travelled from design software to factory to gallery without coming in to contact with anything warmblooded. “More like the reusable hand towels you get in public loos,” I counter, less from a place of conviction than from a reluctance to admit defeat. She sighs, looks at me with a one-two punch of pity and incredulity, and delivers the final blow. “It’s just so… obvious.”
            
            By the time we leave the exhibition I’m facing an unattractive realisation: my wife and I have become the art-viewing equivalent of provincial tourists
            
            By the time we leave the exhibition I’m facing an unattractive realisation: my wife and I have become the art-viewing equivalent of provincial tourists. We are now the kinds of people who will go to any length to maintain their delusion of authority, insisting that the street on which they are lost looks just like their home town, and squabbling over whether the waiter with whom they’re failing to communicate looks more like uncle John or cousin Rob. Because, in the Hand Towel vs Firehose debate, what we were both unwilling to admit was that an unfamiliar object existed beyond our capacity to comprehensively account for it. (That evening I google reviews of the exhibition, and find it confidently summarised as the interior of a whale, and a London Routemaster bus. Apophenia, it seems, is a common condition.)
            
            Nobody wants to be that tourist. As mist, description had made me aware that I’d been harbouring an overfamiliarity with the material world. During the coming weeks, in an attempt to rectify the problem, I try to embrace a state of not knowing, turning to the philosopher Graham Harman as an aid. In his 2010 book Towards Speculative Realism, Harman argues against anthropocentrism, the tendency to perceive phenomena primarily based upon their value to humans. Instead, he makes the case for considering objects as autonomous entities, beyond the limited scope of their role as a tool or possession. ‘To create something’, he says, ‘does not mean to see through to its depths.’ Harman’s point appears to be simple: just as a child must learn that the world does not disappear when they close their eyes, we must also learn that the products of human endeavour move beyond our control and knowledge. Applying this theory to everyday life, however, is considerably more difficult. Opening the fridge one morning to get the milk for my cereal, the appliance I once considered primarily as ‘mine’ is instead an assembly of rubber seals, plastic casings, welded and coated steel, and other alien parts, each the product of different economic, material and labour ecosystems, each with a language, history and lifespan profoundly other to my own. I close the door on this chasm of estrangement, and opt for a banana instead.
            
            Opening the fridge one morning to get the milk for my cereal, the appliance I once considered primarily as ‘mine’ is instead an assembly of rubber seals, plastic casings and other alien parts…each with a language, history and lifespan profoundly other to my own
            
            To the question ‘What kind of art do you like?’ I am yet to reply, ‘Anything that makes me feel fundamentally alienated from the world in which I live every time I open the fridge’. This, however, is precisely what I admire about Reus’s work. She keeps the chasm open. I consider this to be a type of realism: an attempt to speak of the material world, not as we would prefer to see it, but in its own tongue. Today this is no easy task. Little wonder there has been a resurgent interest in handmade arts and craft histories, for nostalgic practices that affirm the primacy of the human touch. The industrial, global and often unknowable life of today’s object offers little in the way of succour, to artist or to viewer.
            
            Exemplary of this realism is Leaves, a series of sculptures for which Reus won the Prix de Rome in 2015. At first glance the objects appear to be oversize padlocks, with metal shanks protruding from the top, and parts of their internal mechanisms exposed. Yet the shanks are incomplete, and in a number of the works, the body of the object is produced from multiple layers, making it impossible to consider the lock as a single, unitary entity, or even as a lock at all. Leaves sets in motion a type of semantic entropy: just as repeating a word over and again distances it from its referent, each iteration of the ‘lock’ further erodes my ability to quantify it. The effect is rather like misplacing a familiar phrase, only to discover that you’ve lost an entire language.
            
            Part of what makes viewing Reus’s sculptures so disorientating is that despite their alienness, they also appear to be entirely plausible. Surfaces are cast, milled and powder-coated, colours unremarkably schematised, each assemblage evidently the result of purposeful design processes. Their familiar, professional bearing is such that my inability to define them is matched by a persistent sensation that at any moment I will be able to. When Leaves was installed at Hepworth Wakefield in 2015, as part of Reus’s exhibition Particle Of Inch, it was shown alongside In Place Of (2015). A series of floor-based sculptures, In Place Of demonstrates Reus’s unsettling ability to stretch the possibilities of classification in multiple and contradictory directions at once. Each work is a variation on a theme: a low, fastidiously well turned-out structure that could convincingly pass as a maquette of a modernist villa or car park, a plinth, a coffee table or even a giant circuitboard, and upon which a variety of miscellaneous and equally fugitive items are displayed.
            
            To view In Place Of is to succumb to an anxiety of taxonomy: the more credible explanations that emerge, the less I feel capable of resolving the nature of the object in question. This combination of uncertainty and self-possession is what gives Reus’s work its distinct psychological profile. It also puts me in mind of Julia Kristeva’s theory of the stranger. The Bulgarian-French writer believes that we are all, to varying degrees, strangers to each other and to ourselves, and that we cover over our inner turmoil by creating an outer shell, learning to ‘settle within the self with a smooth, opaque certainty – an oyster shut under the flooding tide, or the expressionless joy of warm stones’. Just as strangers go unnoticed when dressed in familiar clothes, in Reus’s sculptures, ontological disquiet is presented with the blank confidence of commercial finishing techniques. A portrait of the object for the present day.
